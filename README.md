# Skin-lesion
Computer aided diagnosis for detection of skin lesions Accomplished the classification of malignant and benign skin lesion using an hybrid cnn model with an accuracy of 92%
for many years, skin cancer rates have been on the rise worldwide. Detecting it through images can be tricky due to the subtle changes in skin lesions. To tackle this
challenge, we set out to build a Deep Learning model that could classify skin lesions as Malignant or Benign. We started by gathering images from the ISIC 2017 dataset and pre processed them by removing hair, segmenting, and augmenting the images. Then, we used pre-trained CNN models like MobileNet, ResNet50, and VGG16. We even combined ResNet50
and VGG16 with an SVM classifier for better results. Finally, we evaluated our results using metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1-score, ROC curve, and validation accuracy curve.
